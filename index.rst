SecureDrop Support Documentation
================================

Freedom of the Press Foundation uses a `Redmine`_-based ticketing system for all
support requests related to SecureDrop. This system offers simple, centralized
assistance to the administrators who maintain SecureDrop instances and the
journalists who use them. Running a SecureDrop is hard work. We at FPF are
committed to offering support during installation and into the working life of
an organization's SecureDrop instance.

.. note:: The `support site`_ is also available as a Tor Onion Service at
          http://sup6h5iyiyenvjkfxbgrjynm5wsgijjoatvnvdgyyi7je3xqm4kh6uqd.onion/.

.. _`Redmine`: https://www.redmine.org/
.. _`support site`: https://support.freedom.press/

Getting Started
---------------

Current SecureDrop users should get started by :doc:`creating an account
<creating_your_account>`. Support is available :doc:`on the web <using_redmine>`
or by :doc:`encrypted email<encrypted_email_overview>`. The two support methods
can also be used interchangeably.
