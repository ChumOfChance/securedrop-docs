Troubleshooting
===============

Email notifications
-------------------

If you'd rather not receive emails for your own comments on issues,
there's a setting for that. Go to the "My account" page, select " I
don't want to be notified of changes that I make myself" under "Email
notifications" and hit Save.

Inline replies
--------------

When responding to issues, you should only use the "Quote" button if you
want to make an inline reply. Otherwise, hit "Edit".

Customizing "My Page"
---------------------

There's a shortcut in the main menu called "My page". Typically, this
starts out as a list of issues that are assigned to you and issues that
have been reported to you. However, it can be personalized further to include
stuff like issues you're watching, documents, and the latest news from your
project.
