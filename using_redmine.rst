Onboarding Issue
----------------

By the time you log in, we'll have created an initial issue for
onboarding, called "Onboarding Verification". Please write a reply on
this issue, which will let us know that you succeeded in logging in and
finding your project page.

To write a reply, click **Edit** button at the bottom of the issue.
Write your reply in the Notes text box, then click **Submit**.

We'll reply to the issue and start a little exchange to explain some
features of the platform and answer any questions you might have. The
goal here is to make sure you're comfortable and confident using the new
Support site.

Once we're satisfied you're ready to use the new site, we'll close the
issue.

Description fields. All other fields can be left blank, although you can
assign a priority if you want. When we see the issue, we will respond
and assign it to the appropriate person. If we're waiting for a reply
from someone in your organization, we may assign it back to you.

Creating a new issue via email

Documents, Wiki, and Files

In addition to the Activity pane which lists recent updates, your
subproject has modules for Documents, Wiki, and Files. This is where we
intend to store any technical documentation related to your SecureDrop
