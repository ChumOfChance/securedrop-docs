Using Redmine
-------------

Once your account has been activated, go to
`support.freedom.press <https://support.freedom.press>`_
to log in with your new account.

|Login|
|Home|

After logging in, click on Projects in the top menu bar. You'll see a
project for your specific instance listed underneath SecureDrop, which
only Freedom of the Press Foundation and people within your organization
have access to. Click on it. You'll be shown an Overview of the project
and all of the issues that are open, which are also listed under the
Issues pane.

We've created an initial ticket for onboarding, called "Onboarding
verification". Please reply to this, verifying you have logged in and
added your PGP public key.

To do so, click Edit at the bottom of the issue, add some Notes, and
click Submit. This is a useful test to make sure you're able to use our
Redmine. When we acknowledge your response and close that ticket, you
should receive an encrypted e-mail notification; if you don't please let
us know.

In addition to the Activity pane which lists recent updates, your
subproject has modules for Documents, Wiki, and Files. This is where we
intend to store any technical documentation related to your SecureDrop
instance.

To make a new ticket, click "New issue" and fill out the Subject and
Description fields. All other fields can be left blank, although you can
assign a priority if you want. When we see the issue, we will respond
and assign it to the appropriate person. If we're waiting for a reply
from someone in your organization, we may assign it back to you. Sending
an e-mail to support@freedom.press will automatically create a new
ticket in your project, with the title as the subject line.

Under your account settings (accessible in the top right corner) you may
set your local time zone. We encourage you to leave the notification
setting as the default: "For any event on all my projects".

For further instruction on using Redmine, please consult their `User
Guide <https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/User_Guide>`_.
