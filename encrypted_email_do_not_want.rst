What if I don't want to use encrypted email?
============================================

That's fine! You can do everything through the web interface that you
can do through email.

If you don't do the setup process for receiving encrypted emails from
our support server, you will still receive email alerts for changes to
issues in your project, but the content of the email will not be
included. This is called a "filtered" email.

|FilteredEmail|

We encourage you to use these filtered emails as a reminder to login to
your Redmine account and check the content of the corresponding updates
to an issue through the web interface. We like to think of them as "poor
man's push notifications".

.. note:: We welcome feedback on how we could make notifications for
          this Redmine system more convenient for you.
