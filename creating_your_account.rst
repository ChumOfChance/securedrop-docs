Creating your Account
---------------------

To get started, register your account at
`support.freedom.press/account/register <https://support.freedom.press/account/register>`_.
Choose a strong password, and use an e-mail address that you frequently
check. We have to manually confirm each new account, so after submitting
your registration you'll need to wait until you receive an e-mail saying
your account has been activated before proceeding further.
