Onboarding Issue
================

By the time you've logged in, we'll have created an initial issue for
onboarding, called "Onboarding Verification". Please write a reply on
this issue, which will let us know that you succeeded in logging in and
finding your project page.

To do so, click **Edit** button at the bottom of the issue. Write your
reply in the Notes text box, then click Submit. We'll reply to the issue
and start a little exchange to explain some features of the platform and
answer any questions you might have. The goal here is to make sure
you're comfortable and confident using the new Support site.

Once we're satisfied you're ready to use the new site, we'll close the
issue.
