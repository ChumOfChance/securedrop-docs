Overview
========

Freedom of the Press Foundation is transitioning to a Redmine-based
ticketing system for all support requests related to SecureDrop. All
current and future SecureDrop administrators are required to use the new
support system in order to receive support from FPF staff. From now on,
the best way to get in touch with us is through
`support.freedom.press <https://support.freedom.press>`_
or by emailing support@freedom.press.

As a current SecureDrop administrator or journalist, you will need to
spend a little time setting up an account on our new support site,
`support.freedom.press <https://support.freedom.press>`_.
This process should be quick and easy, and is documented in
:ref:`Creating your Account`.

Once your account has been created, there are two workflows you can use:
a web-based workflow, and an email-based workflow. Either workflow may
be used interchangeably. We think most people will want to use the
web-based workflow, which is documented in :ref:`Using Redmine`. You can
learn more about configuring and using the email-based workflow in
:ref:`Encrypted Email Workflow`.

Why are we doing this?
----------------------

Our goal with this new system is to simplify and centralize the process
of providing assistance to users of SecureDrop, making it easier for
both us and you. Previously, we had asked people to email us. These
email threads were difficult to follow, especially when they're
encrypted and thus not searchable, and when multiple people are CC'ed,
which quickly becomes a headache in terms of PGP key management. It can
be a challenge to find the information you are looking for or remember
where the conversation left off, when they are frequently spread across
different channels like Signal messages or OTR chats, too.

By moving support requests into Redmine tickets, we can keep much better
track of the status and scope of an issue, the person who is responsible
for dealing with it, and make sure everyone is apprised of the
discussion who needs to be. Reviewing the ticket's history allows
someone to quickly obtain a full understanding of the problem, without
having to resort to searching within encrypted emails. We can collect
all of the information relevant to your organization's deployment in one
place, and it's more efficient and less confusing for us when we're
dealing with multiple conversations simultaneously across several
SecureDrop instances.

Administering a SecureDrop instance is hard work, and we hope that this
new system will make us more effective in providing help to you. Don't
hesitate to let us know if you have any feedback on the new support
system.
