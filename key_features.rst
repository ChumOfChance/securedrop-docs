Key Features
============

Making a new issue
------------------

To make a new issue, click "New issue" and fill out the Subject and
Description fields. All other fields can be left blank, although you can
assign a priority if you want. When we see the issue, we will respond
and assign it to the appropriate person. If we're waiting for a reply
from someone in your organization, we may assign it back to you.

Sending an e-mail to support@freedom.press will automatically create a
new issue in your project, using the subject line for the Subject and
the body for the Description.

Documents, Wiki, and Files
--------------------------

In addition to the Activity pane which lists recent updates, your
subproject has modules for Documents, Wiki, and Files. This is where we
intend to store any technical documentation related to your SecureDrop
instance.

Account Settings
----------------

Under your account settings (accessible in the top right corner) you may
set your local time zone. We encourage you to leave the notification
setting as the default: "For any event on all my projects".
