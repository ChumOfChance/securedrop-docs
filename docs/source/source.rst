What is SecureDrop?
-------------------

SecureDrop is a tool that news organizations and NGOs use that enables secure
and anonymous communication between whistleblowers and journalists.
No personal information is collected; information submitted to SecureDrop is
encrypted, and SecureDrop is not a “cloud” service. If you don’t have sensitive
information to send to a news organization, it may be okay to use a traditional
methods such as phone or email when reaching out.

SecureDrop can accept both messages and individual file uploads (up to 500MB).
If you have multiple files to submit, you may do that. As a source, you can also
return to receive follow-up correspondence with an organization,
or to send additional information. Dozens of news organizations
— from *ProPublica* to *The New York Times* — use SecureDrop
to accept tips securely and anonymously.

To truly protect your anonymity, it is important for you to take
some extra precautions in advance. This resource will describe things
you can do to help protect your anonymity when using SecureDrop.
Note that your Internet Service Provider, or ISP (e.g., Comcast/Xfinity,
