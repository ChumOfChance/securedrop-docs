After You Submit
================

Continuing the Conversation
---------------------------

If you have already submitted a document and would like to check for
responses, click the **Log in** button on the media
organization's SecureDrop page.

|Source Interface with JavaScript Disabled|

The next page will ask for your secret codename. Enter it and click
**Continue**.

|Check for response|

If a journalist has responded, their message will appear on the
next page. Before leaving the page, you should
delete any replies. In the unlikely event that someone learns
your codename, this will ensure that they will not be able to see the previous
correspondences you had with journalists.

|Check for a reply|

After you delete the reply from the journalist, make sure you see the
confirmation message: "Reply deleted".
