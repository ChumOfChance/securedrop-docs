SecureDrop for Journalists
==========================

.. include:: ../includes/provide-feedback.txt

This guide presents an overview of the SecureDrop system for a
journalist. It covers the core functions necessary to start working
with the platform: logging in securely, viewing documents, editing
documents, and interacting with sources.

Journalists will use at least two separate computers to interact with
SecureDrop. The first is a *Journalist Workstation*, which connects to
the *Journalist Interface*. Journalists download encrypted submissions and
copy them to a *Transfer Device* (a thumb drive or DVD). Those submissions
are then connected to the airgapped *Secure Viewing Station* (*SVS*) which
holds the key to decrypt them. The *SVS* is used to read, print, and
otherwise prepare documents for publication. Apart from those deliberately
published, decrypted documents are never accessed on an Internet-connected
computer.

SecureDrop provides a number of benefits intended to protect journalists.
Communications through SecureDrop are encrypted in transit, so messages
cannot be easily intercepted and read while they are moving across the
Internet, and are also encrypted on the server so if any attacker manages
to break into the server, they would not be able to read past messages.

In addition, the decryption key for submissions resides on an air-gapped
computer (not connected to the Internet), which makes it harder for an 
attacker to access.

It also helps in the event of a subpoena or court order. All servers are
owned by the individual news organization, so no third-party companies
can be secretly subpoenaed. Additionally, SecureDrop limits the amount of
metadata it collects and saves, so there's no trail showing exactly when
a journalist was speaking with a source, or details that might give
the source away.
