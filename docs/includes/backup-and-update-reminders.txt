Back Up the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------
USB flash drives degrade over time and vary in quality. To ensure continued
access to SecureDrop by administrators and journalists, we recommend backing up
the Tails Workstations on the occasion of a new SecureDrop release, after you
have completed the upgrade process for each drive.

You can use a single storage device for backups of multiple workstations. See
our :doc:`Workstation Backup Guide <../backup_workstations>` for more information.

Apply Any Available Firewall Updates
------------------------------------
As part of SecureDrop maintenance, we recommend checking for software
updates for the hardware firewall, which may need to be applied manually. If
you are using one of the recommended firewalls, see :ref:`Keeping pfSense up to date`
or  see :ref:`Keeping OPNSense up to date`.
