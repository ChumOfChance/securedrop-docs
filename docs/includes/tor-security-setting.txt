.. note::

   If the QR code for setting up two-factor authentication in your mobile authenticator app is not
   displayed, it may be blocked by Tor Browser. You can set Tor Browser's security level to
   **Standard** by clicking on the Shield icon. Alternatively, you can manually type in the
   two-factor secret (in FreeOTP, use the **Add token** option from the menu).
