.. note:: 
          It is generally good practice to maintain a clean git history by
          reducing the number of commits to a reasonable minimum. You can do 
          this by squashing closely related commits through an interactive 
          rebase once your PR is close to being merged. If you are unfamiliar 
          with how to squash commits with rebase, check out this 
          `blog post <http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html>`__.

          If you would like a project maintainer to help you with squashing 
          commits in a PR, please don't hesitate to leave a comment requesting
          assistance.
