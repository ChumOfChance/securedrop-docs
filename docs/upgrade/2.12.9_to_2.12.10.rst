Upgrade from 2.12.9 to 2.12.10
==============================

This version of SecureDrop coincides with the release of `Tails 7 <https://tails.net/news/version_7.0/>`_. SecureDrop 2.12.10 adds compatibility with Tails 7, but is not compatible with earlier versions of Tails. Consequently, your *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations* Tails USBs also require a manual upgrade to Tails 7. To complete the entire upgrade process successfully, you must follow the steps below in order:

.. important:: We recommend backing up your workstations prior to
  any upgrades. See our :ref:`backup instructions <backup_workstations>`
  for more information.

1. Begin upgrade to SecureDrop 2.12.10 using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.net/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

.. important:: Only begin the upgrade using the graphical updater if you are prepared to subsequently upgrade the Tails USB to Tails 7.

If you are ready, initiate the update to 2.12.10 by clicking "Update Now":

.. image:: ../images/securedrop-updater.png

The updater will fail with the following error: ::

  This version of securedrop-admin requires Tails 7 or later

This is expected and you should proceed to the next step.

2. Perform manual upgrade to Tails 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the `instructions to perform a manual Tails upgrade <../admin/maintenance/update_tails_usbs.html#update-manually>`_ to install Tails 7 on your *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*. 

3. Complete upgrade to SecureDrop 2.12.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reboot each *Journalist* and *Admin Workstation* after successfully upgrading to Tails 7 and run the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  sudo apt update
  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig


Rollback: Restore a broken upgrade
==================================

If you ran the SecureDrop graphical updater but are unable to upgrade the Tails USB to Tails 7, the affected SecureDrop *Journalist* or *Admin Workstation* will no longer work. You can fix this by rolling back an affected *Journalist* or *Admin Workstation* to SecureDrop version 2.12.9.

First delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.12.9

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.12.9

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.12.9' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  sudo apt update
  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig
