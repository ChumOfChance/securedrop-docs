Upgrade from 1.7.0 to 1.7.1
===========================

SecureDrop 1.7.1 is a bugfix release to address an issue introduced in
SecureDrop 1.7.0 which caused an outage for some long-running SecureDrop
instances. Please see :doc:`1.6.0_to_1.7.0` for important information about
SecureDrop 1.7.0.

Automatic server upgrades
-------------------------
As with previous releases, your servers will be upgraded to the latest version
of SecureDrop automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Because this release resolves an ongoing outage for some instances, you may
want to :ref:`apply it immediately <immediate_update>`.

Updating Workstations to SecureDrop 1.7.1
-----------------------------------------

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 1.7.1 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 1.7.1

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 1.7.1

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '1.7.1' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig
