Upgrade from 2.3.2 to 2.4.0
===========================

Update Servers to SecureDrop 2.4.0
----------------------------------
Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Update Workstations to SecureDrop 2.4.0
---------------------------------------

.. note::

   If you encounter errors with the graphical updater, perform a
   manual update. This will ensure that you have imported the new
   `SecureDrop release signing key <https://media.securedrop.org/media/documents/signing-key-transition.txt>`_.

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.4.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.4.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.4.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.4.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Tor Browser security issue
--------------------------

Tails has `published an advisory <https://tails.boum.org/security/prototype_pollution/>`__
for a serious security issue in Tor Browser affecting all versions of Tails. Administrators
and journalists should disable JavaScript by `setting Tor Browser’s security level to “Safest”
<https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html#security-level>`__
until a fix is available (expected on May 31, 2022). If you are using Tor Browser in Tails
for non-SecureDrop browsing, we recommend restarting Tor Browser before and after using it
for SecureDrop.

Upgrade from Tails 4 to Tails 5
-------------------------------

If you have not already done so, you must manually upgrade from the Tails 4 release
series to the Tails 5 series.

.. important::

   You must upgrade your workstations to the latest version of SecureDrop by following
   the steps above *before* upgrading to the Tails 5 series. You can verify the version
   of SecureDrop by running ``git status`` in your ``~/Persistent/securedrop`` directory.
   The output should include "HEAD detached at 2.4.0".

The Tails 5 series is based on Debian 11 ("Bullseye"). Among the most noticeable
changes is the switch to a new frontend for GnuPG called Kleopatra. Once you
upgrade your *Secure Viewing Station*, you will need to use Kleopatra to open
``.gpg`` files. Please see our :ref:`Journalist Guide <decrypting>`
for more information.

You must perform the upgrade to Tails 5 manually. You need a blank USB drive
that you can install the latest release in the Tails 5 series on from scratch.
You will use this drive to upgrade your *Journalist Workstation(s)*, your
*Admin Workstation(s)*, and your *Secure Viewing Station(s)*.

The persistent storage volumes of your USB drives will be migrated as part of
this upgrade, but we still highly recommend backing them up first. Follow the
steps for :ref:`updating Tails manually <Update Tails Manually>`.

Fore each *Journalist* and *Admin Workstation*, perform the following additional
steps to complete the upgrade:

1. Boot the USB drive
2. On the Tails welcome screen, unlock the persistent volume and configure an
   administrator password
3. Open a terminal (**Applications ▸ Utilities ▸ Terminal**)
4. Run the following commands:

::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop/admin
  rm -rf .venv3
  cd ..
  ./securedrop-admin setup

When prompted by Tails to "Install Only Once" or "Install Every Time", click
**Install Every Time** (this is a change from previous versions of Tails).

Language support changes
------------------------

We are pleased to announce support for Portuguese (Portugal). To enable this language,
on the *Admin Workstation* run: ::

  ./securedrop-admin sdconfig

When prompted, add ``pt_PT`` to the list of locales. Then run: ::

  ./securedrop-admin install

We are currently lacking translators for Hindi and Romanian, which are both at risk
of being removed in the next SecureDrop release. If you speak either language or know
someone who does, please see our instructions on :ref:`contributing translations<Translations>`.
