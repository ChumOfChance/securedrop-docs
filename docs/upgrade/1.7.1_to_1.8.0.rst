Upgrade from 1.7.1 to 1.8.0
===========================

.. important::

  You must migrate your SecureDrop servers to Ubuntu 20.04 before **April 30,
  2021** to keep your SecureDrop instance operational. This migration will require
  physical access to the servers. Please see our :doc:`migration guide <focal_migration>`
  for instructions.

Updating Servers to SecureDrop 1.8.0
------------------------------------
Your servers will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop automatically
within 24 hours of the release.

Updating Workstations to SecureDrop 1.8.0
-----------------------------------------

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 1.8.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 1.8.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 1.8.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '1.8.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

.. include:: ../includes/always-backup.txt

Updating Tails
--------------
Check the version of Tails on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations*
(**Applications ▸ Tails ▸ About Tails**). If your workstations are running Tails
version 4.14 or earlier, you will not receive an update notification due to a
bug. Perform a :ref:`manual update <Update Tails Manually>`, or reinstate
automatic updates by following the steps in the
`Tails advisory <https://tails.boum.org/news/version_4.14/broken_upgrades/index.en.html>`__.

If you are running Tails 4.15 or later, follow the graphical prompts to update
to the latest version.

Migration to Ubuntu 20.04 and to v3 onion services
--------------------------------------------------
The operating system running on your *Application* and *Monitor Servers*,
Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), reaches its end-of-life for security updates on April 30,
2021. You must migrate your servers to Ubuntu 20.04 before April 30, 2021 to
remain secure. Please see our :doc:`migration guide <focal_migration>` for detailed
instructions.

.. important ::

   If your servers are running Ubuntu 16.04 after **April 30, 2021**, the
   *Source Interface* will be automatically disabled as a security precaution.

Because  v2 :ref:`onion services <glossary_onion_service>` are deprecated,
SecureDrop does not support enabling them on Ubuntu 20.04. If you are not already
running v3 onion services (easily recognizable by their 56 character ``.onion``
addresses), you can :doc:`enable them <../v3_services>` prior to the migration
to Ubuntu 20.04, or as part of the same maintenance window.
