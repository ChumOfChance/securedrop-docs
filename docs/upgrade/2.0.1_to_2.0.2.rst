Upgrade from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2
===========================

Updating Servers to SecureDrop 2.0.2
------------------------------------
Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Updating Workstations to SecureDrop 2.0.2
-----------------------------------------

.. note::

   If you encounter errors with the graphical updater, perform a
   manual update. This will ensure that you have imported the new
   `SecureDrop release signing key <https://media.securedrop.org/media/documents/signing-key-transition.txt>`_.

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.0.2 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.0.2

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 2.0.2

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.0.2' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Updating Tails
--------------
Check the version of Tails on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations*
(**Applications ▸ Tails ▸ About Tails**). If your workstations are running Tails
version 4.14 or earlier, you will not receive an update notification due to a
bug. Perform a :ref:`manual update <Update Tails Manually>`, or reinstate
automatic updates by following the steps in the
`Tails advisory <https://tails.boum.org/news/version_4.14/broken_upgrades/index.en.html>`__.

If you are running Tails 4.15 or later, follow the graphical prompts to update
to the latest version.

Troubleshooting Kernel Issues
-----------------------------
SecureDrop 2.0.2 includes a kernel update on the *Application* and *Monitor
Servers*, from version 5.4.97 to version 5.4.136. As with all kernel updates,
we have extensively tested this update against
:ref:`recommended hardware <Specific Hardware Recommendations>`.

If you are running SecureDrop on hardware that is not officially supported, you
may encounter compatibility issues with the new kernel. For example, the servers
may not boot, or you may lose network connectivity. If this happens, you can
temporarily downgrade to the previous kernel version.

.. important::

   To ensure continued secure operation of your SecureDrop instance, it is of
   critical importance to resolve any compatibility issues with the new kernel
   as quickly as possible. If you encounter problems with this update, please
   get in touch with us urgently, so we can help you run the latest supported
   kernel version.

For information on how to downgrade to the previous kernel, and for additional
troubleshooting information, please see our :doc:`Kernel Troubleshooting Guide <../kernel_troubleshooting>`.
