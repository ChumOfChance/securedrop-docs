Upgrade from 2.12.0 to 2.12.1
=============================

SecureDrop 2.12.1 is an Admin Workstation-only release, which improves the reliability of the semiautomated Ubuntu Noble upgrade when using SSH-over-Tor. 

Migrating to Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)
---------------------------------

As a reminder, it is necessary to upgrade your SecureDrop Servers to Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) due to the upcoming end-of-life for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal).

Administrators have two options, on the following timeline:

* **semiautomated, through April 15, 2025:** Administrators can manually trigger the upgrade and observe the process.
* **fully automated, after April 15, 2025:** The SecureDrop team will push an update in mid- to late-April that automatically begins the upgrade process on all servers.

To determine which option is best for you, and to learn more about how the upgrade works, please review the :doc:`Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) migration guide <../admin/maintenance/noble_migration>` at your earliest convenience.
    
Servers to Remain on 2.12.0
---------------------------

As this is an Admin Workstation-only release, servers will not receive an update and will remain on version 2.12.0. Please note, upgrading to SecureDrop 2.12.0 does not automatically upgrade your server to Ubuntu 24.04.

Update Workstations to SecureDrop 2.12.1
----------------------------------------

.. important:: We recommend backing up your workstations prior to
  any upgrades. See our :ref:`backup instructions <backup_workstations>`
  for more information.

Update to SecureDrop 2.12.1 using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.net/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.12.1 by clicking "Update Now":

Fallback: Perform a manual update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.12.1

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.12.1

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.12.1' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  sudo apt update
  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig
