Upgrade from 1.8.1 to 1.8.2
===========================

.. important::

   If you have not migrated your servers to Ubuntu 20.04 yet, you must do so
   at the earliest opportunity. Servers running on Ubuntu 16.04 no longer
   receive operating system or SecureDrop software updates at this point.

   Please see our :doc:`migration guide <focal_migration>` for instructions
   for performing a migration, or :doc:`reinstall SecureDrop <../overview>`.

Updating Servers to SecureDrop 1.8.2
------------------------------------
Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Updating Workstations to SecureDrop 1.8.2
-----------------------------------------

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 1.8.2 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 1.8.2

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 1.8.2

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '1.8.2' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Updating Tails
--------------
Check the version of Tails on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations*
(**Applications ▸ Tails ▸ About Tails**). If your workstations are running Tails
version 4.14 or earlier, you will not receive an update notification due to a
bug. Perform a :ref:`manual update <Update Tails Manually>`, or reinstate
automatic updates by following the steps in the
`Tails advisory <https://tails.boum.org/news/version_4.14/broken_upgrades/index.en.html>`__.

If you are running Tails 4.15 or later, follow the graphical prompts to update
to the latest version.
