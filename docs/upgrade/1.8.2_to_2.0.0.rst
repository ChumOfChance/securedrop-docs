Upgrade from 1.8.2 to 2.0.0
===========================

.. note::

   If you are not already using Tails 4.19 or greater on your workstations, you
   will need to :ref:`update manually due to a bug <Tails Broken Updates 2021>`.


Updating Servers to SecureDrop 2.0.0
------------------------------------
Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

.. important::

   If your servers are still running Ubuntu 16.04, you will not receive this
   update, as the operating system has reached its end-of-life. Please
   contact us if you require assistance reinstalling SecureDrop.

Updating Workstations to SecureDrop 2.0.0
-----------------------------------------

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.0.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 2.0.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"


.. include:: ../includes/release-key-transition.txt

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 2.0.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.0.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

.. include:: ../includes/always-backup.txt

.. _Tails Broken Updates 2021:

Updating Tails
--------------
Check the version of Tails on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations*
(**Applications ▸ Tails ▸ About Tails**). If your workstations are running Tails
version 4.18 or earlier, Tails may fail to notify you of updates, or may display
an error message.

Perform a :ref:`manual update <Update Tails Manually>`, or reinstate
automatic updates by running the following command: ::

  torsocks curl --silent https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrg-root-x1-cross-signed.pem | \
  sudo tee --append /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/tails.boum.org-CA.pem && \
  systemctl --user restart tails-upgrade-frontend

After a short delay, Tails should notify you about the availability of updates,
allowing you to use the Tails graphical updater.
