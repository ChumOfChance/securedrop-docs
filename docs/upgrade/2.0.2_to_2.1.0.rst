Upgrade from 2.0.2 to 2.1.0
===========================

Updating Servers to SecureDrop 2.1.0
------------------------------------
Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Updating Workstations to SecureDrop 2.1.0
-----------------------------------------

.. note::

   If you encounter errors with the graphical updater, perform a
   manual update. This will ensure that you have imported the new
   `SecureDrop release signing key <https://media.securedrop.org/media/documents/signing-key-transition.txt>`_.

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.1.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.1.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 2.1.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.1.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Updating Tails
--------------
Follow the graphical prompts to update to the latest version of the Tails
operating system on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations*.

.. important ::

   Older versions of Tails had problems with automatic updates, which SecureDrop
   tries to correct automatically. Check the version of Tails on your *Admin* and
   *Journalist Workstations* (**Applications ▸ Tails ▸ About Tails**). If you are
   running a version older than Tails 4.23, and did not receive an automatic
   upgrade prompt after connecting to the Internet, perform a
   :ref:`manual update <Update Tails Manually>`. If this also fails, please
   don't hesitate to contact us.
