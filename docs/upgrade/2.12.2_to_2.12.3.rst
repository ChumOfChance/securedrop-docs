Upgrade from 2.12.2 to 2.12.3
=============================

Migrating to Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)
---------------------------------

After an initial set of successfully fully automated upgrades to Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) with the 2.12.2 release, we are now enabling the next batch of automated uprades. In practice, this will result in approximately 40% of *Application Servers* being upgraded.

If you receive :doc:`pre-upgrade error notifications <../admin/maintenance/noble_migration_prep>` from OSSEC, please review our :doc:`Noble upgrade guide <../admin/maintenance/noble_migration>`.

This release also addresses an issue where some SecureDrop instances that failed the pre-upgrade migration check could remain in a state with automatic updates disabled. The SecureDrop team is monitoring known servers; if we believe this bug as affected you, we will reach out with steps to re-enable automatic updates.

Update Workstations to SecureDrop 2.12.3
----------------------------------------

.. important:: We recommend backing up your workstations prior to
  any upgrades. See our :ref:`backup instructions <backup_workstations>`
  for more information.

Update to SecureDrop 2.12.3 using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.net/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.12.3 by clicking "Update Now":

Fallback: Perform a manual update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.12.3

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.12.3

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.12.3' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  sudo apt update
  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig
