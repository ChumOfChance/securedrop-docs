Upgrade from 2.10.1 to 2.11.0
=============================

Preparing for the Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) migration
------------------------------------------------

The 2.11.0 release includes a number of features that will help ensure
your SecureDrop server is prepared for the automated migration to Ubuntu 24.04
(Noble) in early 2025.

After updating to SecureDrop 2.11.0 using the steps below, it's important
that you review our :doc:`Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) migration guide <../admin/maintenance/noble_migration_prep>`,
and run the ``securedrop-noble-migration-check`` script prior to January 31st, 2025
to ensure your server is ready for the migration.


Update Servers to SecureDrop 2.11.0
------------------------------------

Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Update Workstations to SecureDrop 2.11.0
----------------------------------------

.. important:: We always recommend backing up your workstations prior to
  an upgrade, but we *especially* recommend it before a major Tails version
  bump. This upgrade is an excellent occasion to make sure you have fresh
  backups for each of your Tails drives. See our :ref:`backup instructions <backup_workstations>`
  for more information.

Update to SecureDrop 2.11.0 using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.net/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.11.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Fallback: Perform a manual update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.11.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.11.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.11.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  sudo apt update
  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig
