Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

SecureDrop is a multi-machine design. To make development and testing easy, we
provide a set of virtual environments, each tailored for a specific type of
development task. We use Vagrant and VirtualBox to conveniently develop with a
set of virtual environments, and our Ansible playbooks can provison these
environments on either virtual machines or physical hardware.

To get started, you will need to install Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansible on
your development workstation.


Ubuntu/Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Tested on: Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian Stretch

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt-get install -y dpkg-dev virtualbox-dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential git

We recommend using the latest stable version of Vagrant (``1.8.5`` at the time
of this writing), which might be newer than what is in your distro's package
repositories.

If ``apt-cache policy vagrant`` says your candidate version is not at least 1.7,
you should download the current version from the `Vagrant Downloads page`_ and
then install it.

.. code:: sh

    # If you downloaded vagrant.deb from vagrantup.com
    sudo dpkg -i vagrant.deb
    # OR this, if your OS vagrant is recent enough
    sudo apt-get install vagrant

We *do not* recommend using a version of Vagrant older than 1.8.4. For instance,
the version of Vagrant currently in the Ubuntu Trusty repositories is 1.5.4,
which is signficantly out of date and known not to work with SecureDrop (`Github
#932`_, `Github #1381`_).

.. _`Vagrant Downloads page`: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
.. _`GitHub #932`: https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/pull/932
.. _`GitHub #1381`: https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/1381

.. warning:: We do not recommend installing vagrant-cachier. It destroys aptâ€™s
            state unless the VMs are always shut down/rebooted with Vagrant,
            which conflicts with the tasks in the Ansible playbooks. The
            instructions in Vagrantfile that would enable vagrant-cachier are
            currently commented out.

.. todo:: This warning is here because a common refrain during hackathons for
          SecureDrop a while back was "setting up VMs is too slow, you should
          use vagrant-cachier". We tried it and it had some nasty interactions
          with Ansible, so we dropped it, and added this note to prevent other
          people from making the same suggestion. Eventually, we should: (i)
          Build our own base boxes to dramatically cut down on provisioning
          times (ii) Remove this note as well as the commented vagrant-cachier
          lines from the Vagrantfile

Either way, once you've installed Vagrant you should run:

.. code:: sh

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms

Finally, install Ansible so it can be used with Vagrant to automatically
provision VMs. We recommend installing Ansible from PyPi with ``pip`` to ensure
you have the latest stable version.

.. code:: sh

    sudo apt-get install python-pip

The version of Ansible recommended to provision SecureDrop VMs may not be the
same as the version in your distro's repos, or may at some point flux out of
sync. For this reason, and also just as a good general development practice, we
recommend using a Python virtual environment to install version 1.8.4 of
Ansible. We provide instructions using `virtualenvwrapper
<http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and `virtualenv
<https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Using virtualenvwrapper:

.. code:: sh

    sudo apt-get install virtualenvwrapper
    mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 securedrop
    pip install ansible==1.8.4

Using virtualenv (we recommend you `cd` into the  base directory of the repo
before running these commands):

.. code:: sh

    sudo apt-get install virtualenv
    virtualenv -p python2.7 .
    . bin/activate
    pip install ansible==1.8.4

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

Install the dependencies for the development environment:

#. Vagrant_
#. VirtualBox_
#. Ansible_.

   There are several ways to install Ansible on a Mac. We recommend installing
   from PyPi using ``pip`` so you will get the latest stable version:

   .. code:: sh

      sudo easy_install pip && sudo pip install -U ansible

.. _Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
.. _VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
.. _Ansible: http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html

Clone the repository
--------------------

Once you've installed the prerequisites for the development environment,
use git to clone the SecureDrop repo.

.. code:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop.git

SecureDrop uses a branching model based on `git-flow
<http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`__.  The ``master``
branch always points to the latest stable release. Use this branch if you are
interested in installing or auditing SecureDrop.  Development for the upcoming
release of SecureDrop takes place on ``develop``, which is the default
branch. If you want to contribute, you should branch from and submit pull
requests to ``develop``.

.. todo:: The branching model should be documented separately, in a
	  "Contributing guidelines" document. We are also going to move away
	  from git-flow soon because it sucks.

.. todo:: Replace all of this with nc, which is simpler, works well with
	  OpenSSH's ProxyCommand, and is included by default on Ubuntu and Mac
	  OS X.

connect-proxy (Ubuntu only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt-get install connect-proxy

After installing connect-proxy via apt-get and appending the tor config options
to your local config, you can export the environment variable
``SECUREDROP_SSH_OVER_TOR=1`` in order to use ``vagrant ssh`` to access the
prod instances.  Here is an example of how that works:

.. code:: sh

    $ vagrant up --provision /prod/     # restricts SSH to Tor after final reboot
    $ vagrant ssh-config app-prod       # will show incorrect info due to lack of env var
    Host app-prod
      HostName 127.0.0.1
      User vagrant
      Port 2201
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      PasswordAuthentication no
      IdentityFile /home/conor/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
      IdentitiesOnly yes
      LogLevel FATAL
    $ vagrant ssh app-prod -c 'echo hello'   # will fail due to incorrect ssh-config
    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    $ export SECUREDROP_SSH_OVER_TOR=1       # instruct Vagrant to use Tor for SSH
    $ vagrant ssh-config app-prod            # will show correct info, with ProxyCommand
    Host app-prod
      HostName l57xhqhltlu323vi.onion
      User vagrant
      Port 22
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      PasswordAuthentication no
      IdentityFile /home/conor/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
      IdentitiesOnly yes
      LogLevel FATAL
      ProxyCommand connect -R remote -5 -S 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
    $ # ensure ATHS values are active in local Tor config:
    $ cat *-aths | sudo tee -a /etc/tor/torrc > /dev/null && sudo service tor reload
    $ vagrant ssh app-prod -c 'echo hello'   # works
    hello
    Connection to l57xhqhltlu323vi.onion closed.

If ``SECUREDROP_SSH_OVER_TOR`` is declared, Vagrant will look up the ATHS URLs
and ``HidServAuth`` values for each server by examining the contents of
``app-ssh-aths`` and ``mon-ssh-aths`` in ``./install_files/ansible-base``. You
can manually inspect these files to append values to your local ``torrc``, as
in the ``cat`` example above.  Note that the ``cat`` example above will also
add the ATHS info for the Document Interface, as well, which is useful for
testing.

torify (Ubuntu and Mac OS X)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Ubuntu

  ``torsocks`` should be installed by the tor package. If it is not installed,
  make sure you are using tor from the `Tor Project's repo
  <https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en>`__, and not Ubuntu's
  package.

- Mac OS X (Homebrew)

  .. code:: sh

     brew install torsocks

If you have torify on your system (``which torify``) and you're Tor running
in the background, simply prepend it to the SSH command:

.. code:: sh

    torify ssh admin@examplenxu7x5ifm.onion

Tips & Tricks
-------------

Using Tor Browser with the development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We strongly encourage sources to use the Tor Browser when they access
the Source Interface. Tor Browser is the easiest way for the average
person to use Tor without making potentially catastrophic mistakes,
makes disabling Javascript easy via the handy NoScript icon in the
toolbar, and prevents state about the source's browsing habits
(including their use of SecureDrop) from being persisted to disk.

Since Tor Browser is based on an older version of Firefox (usually the
current ESR release), it does not always render HTML/CSS the same as
other browsers (especially more recent versions of browsers). Therefore,
we recommend testing all changes to the web application in the Tor
Browser instead of whatever browser you normally use for web
development. Unfortunately, it is not possible to access the local
development servers by default, due to Tor Browser's proxy
configuration.

To test the development environment in Tor Browser, you need to add an
exception to allow Tor Browser to access localhost:

#. Open the "Tor Browser" menu and click "Preferences..."
#. Choose the "Advanced" section and the "Network" subtab under it
#. In the "Connection" section, click "Settings..."
#. In the text box labeled "No Proxy for:", enter ``127.0.0.1``

   -  Note: for some reason, ``localhost`` doesn't work here.

#. Click "Ok" and close the Preferences window

You should now be able to access the development server in the Tor
Browser by navigating to ``127.0.0.1:8080`` and ``127.0.0.1:8081``.
