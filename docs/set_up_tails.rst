Create Tails USBs
=================

`Tails <https://tails.boum.org>`__ is a privacy-enhancing live operating
system that runs on removable media, such as a DVD or a USB stick. It
sends all your Internet traffic through Tor, does not touch your
computer's hard drive, and securely wipes unsaved work on shutdown.

Most of the work of installing, administering, and using SecureDrop is
done from computers using Tails, so the first thing you need to do is
set up several USB drives with the Tails operating system. To get
started, you'll need two Tails drives: one for the *Admin Workstation*
and one for the *Secure Viewing Station*. :doc:`Later <onboarding_journalists>`,
you'll set up a bunch more Tails drives for your journalists and
backups, but for now you just need two.

As soon as you create a new Tails drive, *label it immediately*. USB
drives all look alike and you're going to be juggling a whole bunch of
them throughout this installation. Label immediately. Always.

.. _setup_install_tails:

Install Tails
-------------

The `Tails website <https://tails.boum.org/>`__ has detailed and
up-to-date instructions on how to download and verify Tails, and how to
create a bootable Tails USB drive.

Follow the instructions at these links and then return to this page:

-  `Download and verify the Tails image
   file <https://tails.boum.org/install/download/index.en.html>`__
-  `Install onto a USB drive <https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html>`__

.. important:: Make sure you verify the Tails .img file using one of the methods
   described on the Tails website.

You will need to create 2 Tails USBs to perform the SecureDrop installation:

#. The *Secure Viewing Station* Tails USB.
#. The *Admin Workstation* Tails USB.

.. tip:: This process will take some time, most of which will be spent
	 waiting around.

Enable Persistent Storage
-------------------------

By default, everything you save while running Tails will be securely
erased and discarded when you power off or reboot your system.

Because we will need to keep certain settings and files saved between
sessions, you will need to enable persistence.

Creating an encrypted persistent volume will allow you to securely save
information and settings in the free space that is left on your Tails
drive. You will need to create a persistent storage on each Tails drive. Each
drive's persistent storage partition needs its own unique, complex 
passphrase that's easy to write down or remember. 

For instructions on how to generate a strong passphrase, see :doc:`the 
Passphrases page <passphrases>`.

Please use the instructions on the `Tails website
<https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html>`__
to make the persistent volume on each Tails drive you create. When
creating the persistence volume, you will be asked to select from a
list of features, such as 'Personal Data'. You should enable **all** features by
selecting each item in the list.

Some other things to keep in mind:

-  Right now, you need to create a persistent volume on both the *Admin
   Workstation* Tails drive and the *Secure Viewing Station* Tails
   drive.

-  Each journalist will need their own Tails drive with their own
   persistent volume secured with their own passphrase â€” but :doc:`that comes
   later <onboarding_journalists>`.

-  Journalists and admins will eventually need to remember these
   passphrases. We recommend using `spaced-repetition
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition>`__  to memorize
   Diceware passphrases.
   
.. note:: Tails doesn't always completely shut down and reboot
	  properly when you click "restart", so if you notice a
	  significant delay, you may have to manually power off and
	  restart your computer for it to work properly.

.. warning:: Make sure that you never use the *Secure Viewing Station*
	     Tails drive on a computer connected to the Internet or a
	     local network. This Tails drive will only be used on the
	     air-gapped *Secure Viewing Station*.
