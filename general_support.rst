General Support
===============

If you haven't installed SecureDrop yet and you'd like our help, or you
have a situation related to digital security for journalists, simply get
started by registering an account in Redmine. Once your account is
manually activated by us, we will assign you to a project called
"Support Triage" where you can open a new issue. Any tickets that
created here will be visible only to Freedom of the Press Foundation and
you.
