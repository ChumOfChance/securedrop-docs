===============

First time getting in touch with us about SecureDrop? Please start by submitting
a request through the `SecureDrop Contact Form`_.

.. _SecureDrop Contact Form: https://securedrop.org/help

Please provide an email address so we can reply back to you. We'll review your
request and decide how to respond. If we decide to offer you support, we will
send you instructions for onboarding you into our support system.

Once you are initially onboarded, we will assign you to a project called
"Support Triage" where you will be able open new issues. Any issues that you
create will only be visible to Freedom of the Press Foundation staff and you.
