General Support
===============

If you haven't installed SecureDrop yet and you'd like our help, or you
have a situation related to digital security for journalists, simply get
started by :doc:`creating an account <creating_your_account>` in Redmine.

Once your account is manually activated by us, we will assign you to a project
called "Support Triage" where you can open a new issue. Any tickets that you
create in this project will only be visible to Freedom of the Press Foundation
staff and you.
